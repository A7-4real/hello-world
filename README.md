# hello-world
A place to store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

Hey Team! Hope you all are healthy and safe.
I'm Akash Kr of Nalanda College Of Engineering, Chandi (CSE). I'm new to open source and looking forward to learn and also contribute to this exciting space.               
After researching a bit, I found caMicroscope project idea to be gripping and a good place to start as caMicroscope community is active and really helpful.

For a start I would like to work on issue #546 (nanoBorb Documentation Missing).
